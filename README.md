# Python projects


- 100 folders for 100 projects
- First 15 Days is at Beginner level.
  - Learning to use conditional statement like if/else/elif
  - Learning to use looping like while/for
  - And integrated projects
- Next 45 Days is intermediate level. 
  - Learning to use classes
  - what is constructor/initializer
  - what is python modules and how they work
  - how python packages work what is __init__ in python package
  - Making some projects using classes
 - Next 40 Days is Advance level

## Day-1
- Random Band Name Generator.
> using two input statement using input and combining them to generate a band name.
- ------------------------------END HERE---------------------

## Day-2
- Tip Calculator.
> - using str/int to sum each number in a string.
> - Mathematical operations using variables to find out how many days or weeks left from current age. if we guess we will live untill the age of 90.
> - BMI calculator using if/else statement and print out the statement about weight.
> - Final project: Taking the amount of bill and adding the interest 6%, 12% and 18% and dividing the total amount amount x number of friends.
- -----------------------------END HERE---------------------

## Day-3
- Option words Game.
> - Leap year calculator using if/else statement.
> - Even/ odd calculator using % modulos operator and if/ else statement.
> - using if/else statement to make a game of left/right and choose and winner will be decided at those options. 
- --------------------------END HERE------------------------

## Day-4
- Rock, Paper and scissors.
> - using random and if/else statement to make a game of rock, paper and scissors. Based on those either we win, lose or Draw.
- ------------------------END HERE--------------------------

## Day-5
- Encrypted Password Generator.
> - using Lists, random and loops to make a random encrypted password generator.
> - Encrypted text means cypher text. (Encryption converts data into scrambled text. The unreadable text can only be decoded with a secret key. The secret key is a number that's: Created on your device and the device you message.)

- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------

## Day-6
- Using Python functions
> - python functinons or functions in general are actions that a prgram performs
> - A function must be specific what it does and must be reusable

- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------
## Day-7
- Making Hangman project
> - Learnig to use modules of code and importing them to perform a specific task
> - use conditional statement for the lives, if the answer is wrong it reduces a live
> - Random word guesser from a list of hundreds of words
> - using while loop to run the game until either the lives are over or the player guessed the word.
> - Also performing the refactoring of code.
> - Also using logos to visualize the lives.

- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------
## Day-8
- Again using functions and passing parameters into the functions

- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------
## Day-9
- Learning python Dictionaries and Nesting
> - Dictionaries work on key: value pair in python
> - Any value can only be accessed or changed by only knowing the key.
> - Key could also be changed as its value or the entire key: value pair.

- An example for accessing both key and value in dictionaries are as follows:
```
python_dictionary = {
 "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.",
 "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.",
 "Loop": "The action of doing something over and over again.",
}
```
- Value can be accessed by;
```
 print(python_dictionary["Bug"])
```
- Another pair of key and value pair could also be created;
```
python_dictionary["Rare"] = "Hello there this is a rare scene"
# print(python_dictionary)
```
- with for loop;
```
for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key) #It will print the key inside the dictionary
    print(programming_dictionary[key]) #Now it will print key and its value.

```
- Nesting
> - Nesting is when a statement is inside another statement. 
> - It could be any type of statements like conditinal inside loop or vice versa.
- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------

## Day-10
- Funcions with output with return statement
> - Functions are usually made to return some value.
> - That's why use return keyword to output some value.
> - Important! return statement will immediately terminate the program so that's why a function could only have one return statement to execute.
>  - When calling the function it is necessary to remember that return value will be stored in the calling statement.
>  - And it could be used to use that data.
>  - print statement inside functions will not return any value, it will just print the calculations not output the value to the program.
>  - And that value can't be used in other parts of the program

- ------------------------END HERE-------------------------

## Day-18
- Class format

- Turtle Shapes

<hr>
- Random walking turtle.

![random_walking_turtle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94203408/172931964-6975f7e5-aabb-426e-a06d-5cf4075609a1.png)

- In the above program we can't use 
```
random_walking_list = [tim.left(90),tim.right(90)]
random.choice(random_walking_list)
```
- Because paranthesis () call the function instantly without giving any room to randomly picking them.
- That's why i use random.randint(0,1) and used condition of what to do with each condition.
