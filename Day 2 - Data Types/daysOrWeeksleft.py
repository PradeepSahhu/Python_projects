#How many days, weeks and years left since you are born using f-string and mathematical operations.

'''Age = int(input("Enter your Age : "))
yearsLeft = (90-Age)
weeksLeft = (90*52)-(Age*52)
daysLeft = (90*365)-(Age*365)
print(f"you have left {daysLeft} days, {weeksLeft} weeks and {yearsLeft} Years")
'''
'''#Alternative way of doing these:
Age = int(input("Enter your current Age: "))
YearsLeft = (90-Age)
weeksLeft = (YearsLeft * 52)
daysLeft = (YearsLeft * 365)
print(f"you have {YearsLeft} years, {weeksLeft} weeks and {daysLeft} days Left")
